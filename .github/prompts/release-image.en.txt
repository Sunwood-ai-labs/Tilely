Minimalist cartoon line art character reference sheet. 
Clean bold lines, vector-style strokes, mostly black and white with flat ice blue accent color. 
Character: a round penguin plush with stubby wings and soft belly. 
Outfit: a cozy knitted beanie and a scarf with pom-poms. 
Sheet layout includes one full-body pose and expressions: waddling, sliding on belly, waving flipper, hugging snowball, looking up, clapping wings. 
Flat modern aesthetic, consistent visual style, clean background.
Place “Tilely - v0.0.0 -” in elegant cursive serif lettering below the penguin, as if it were a brand signature, maintaining a clean and modern composition.
